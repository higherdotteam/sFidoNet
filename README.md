# sFidoNet
slack FidoNet system to send job listings to specific people and to suggest certain people as right person for a job

1. Each slack org is the powerful place of official work business. A message in your company's slack network means something more than an email.

2. Each slack org reminds me of seperate Bulletin Board Systems.

3. Years ago FidoNet would allow messages from one BBS to flow thru a series of hops to reach others.

4. sFidoNet is a modern version for slack networks.
