# sFidoNet
slack FidoNet

1. Each slack org is the powerful place of official work business. A message in your company's slack network means something more than an email.

2. Each slack org reminds me of seperate Bulletin Board Systems.

3. Years ago FidoNet would allow messages from one BBS to flow thru a series of hops to reach others.

4. sFidoNet is a modern version for slack networks.

# Installation

1. First user in a slack org installs the bot and is by default the "ambassador".

2. For example lets say three orgs have installed the bot: spotify, buzzfeed, snapinc and inside each org is John Spoty, Jane Buzz, and Snaz as ambassadors, names are just made up, they mean nothing.

3. Jane Spoty at spotify wants to contact someone at snapinc in the marketing department. She talks to sFido bot in the spotify slack network and says, "hey Fido, I need someone from snapinc marketing for this great idea." Each day John Spoty the ambassadors marks all the messages peoeple his org are trying to get into other orgs as ok or not ok.

4. You build a rep as an ambassador for what messages you allow to flow out of your org. i.e. don't let spam flow out.

5. You also build as an ambassador a network of other ambassadors that want to work with you.

6. Depending on your network ambassador's reach, you might be able to get your message from your org to to next org in 1 hop.

7. This is very much like linkedin's hey send this message to bob you know bob I don't feature, but hopefully with some new twists only possible with slack.
